        name: "Krishna",
        title: "The Avatar of Balance",
        faction: "Divine Ascendants",
        rarity: "Legendary",
        avatar: "K",
        image: "images/legendary/krishna.jpg", // Add: images/krishna.jpg
        loreBackground: `In the cycles of existence, where creation and destruction endlessly dance, Krishna was born as an avatar — the living embodiment of cosmic preservation. Manifested through the will of Vishnu, Krishna descended into the mortal and celestial realms to restore equilibrium during times of extreme chaos.

Unlike many who rule through domination, Krishna's power lies in his divine mastery of both strategy and compassion. In the mortal realm, he played the role of kingmaker, counselor, and protector of dharma — the sacred law of balance. His words have swayed kings, his counsel has determined the course of wars, and his flute's melody carries the frequency of universal order itself.

Among the Divine Ascendants, Krishna operates as both diplomat and tactician, able to read the hearts of friend and foe alike. His charm veils his unparalleled intelligence, allowing him to turn seemingly impossible situations into victories through minimal bloodshed. While others focus on direct battle, Krishna disarms entire armies with wisdom, wit, and strategic brilliance.

His avatar form is not a singular incarnation but a continual expression of Vishnu's desire to preserve life, meaning Krishna exists simultaneously as teacher, warrior, and divine intermediary between realms.`,
        role: "Krishna serves as the Divine Ascendants' master strategist, responsible for navigating political alliances, cosmic negotiations, and tactical battle planning. He ensures that the Divine Ascendants adapt to shifting tides of war without sacrificing their core mission.",

        personality: ["Charismatic", "Playful", "Deeply Wise", "Infinitely Patient"],
        factionImpact: "As the Fallen Titans seek conquest through force and the Primordial Deities manipulate destiny for personal dominion, Krishna remains the Divine Ascendants' greatest weapon against both. His mastery over fate itself allows him to counteract both brute strength and divine schemes, preserving balance amidst a universe at war. Many believe Krishna's influence has prevented multiple realities from falling into irreversible collapse."

        rarity: "Legendary",
        avatar: "B",
        image: "images//legendary/Buddha.jpg", // Add: images/legendary_char_2.jpg
        loreBackground: `Born as Siddhartha under mortal flesh, Buddha transcended the limitations of the physical realm through his unwavering search for truth. Forsaking royal privilege, he sought enlightenment beneath the Bodhi Tree, where the veils of illusion were torn away, revealing the endless cycle of suffering driven by desire, attachment, and ignorance.

Upon attaining full awakening, the Supreme Source elevated Buddha into the ranks of the Divine Ascendants, recognizing him as the eternal symbol of inner mastery. Though lacking in brute force or destructive power, his presence radiates a stillness that disarms even the fiercest adversaries.

Buddha’s enlightenment allows him to see reality without distortion — understanding the true nature of all beings and events as interconnected waves within a vast ocean of existence. He walks not to conquer, but to liberate, offering both mortal and immortal souls a path beyond suffering and conflict.

Among the Divine Ascendants, Buddha serves as the spiritual heart — the one who reminds even the most battle-hardened warriors of their purpose beyond war. His influence extends across realms as both teacher and healer, restoring clarity where fear and rage threaten to take root.`,
        role: "Buddha is the spiritual anchor of the Divine Ascendants, guiding the faction’s moral and emotional compass. His teachings prevent the Ascendants from becoming consumed by vengeance, offering pathways of transcendence even amidst war.",

        factionImpact: "As the Fallen Titans intoxicate the cosmos with hatred and the Primordial Deities escalate the hunger for dominion, Buddha safeguards the Divine Ascendants from spiritual erosion. His enlightenment offers both warriors and civilians the strength to endure suffering without falling to despair or corruption. Many believe his calm presence has averted several factional schisms within the Ascendants themselves."

        name: "Jesus Christ",
        title: "The Messiah of Sacrifice",

        rarity: "Legendary",
        avatar: "JC",
        image: "images/legendary/Christ.jpg", // Add: images/legendary_char_3.jpg
        loreBackground: `In the fullness of time, when humanity stood at the brink of spiritual collapse, the Supreme Source descended into mortal form as Jesus Christ — the embodiment of divine love made flesh. Sent not as a conqueror but as a redeemer, his mission was to bear the burden of mankind’s failures, offering salvation through compassion, sacrifice, and ultimate forgiveness.

Through his teachings, miracles, and martyrdom, Jesus shattered the chains of spiritual death, rewriting the fate of countless souls across countless realms. His resurrection was not merely a victory over mortality, but a cosmic event that permanently altered the spiritual laws of existence, allowing free will to coexist with divine grace.

Elevated into the Divine Ascendants after his earthly mission, Jesus now serves as the living bridge between mortal frailty and divine perfection. His power is not rooted in domination or judgment, but in unconditional love capable of dissolving even the deepest corruption.

Among the Divine Ascendants, he is both healer and redeemer — reaching even into enemy ranks to awaken lost souls, often converting darkness back into light. While others wage war, Jesus wages restoration.`,
        role: "Jesus serves as the Divine Ascendants’ embodiment of grace, redemption, and mercy. He is the faction’s final line of salvation — offering purification to corrupted souls and guiding both allies and enemies toward restoration rather than destruction.",
        signaturePower: "Sacrificial Aegis — Absorbs the suffering and corruption of others into himself, purifying afflicted souls and shielding allies from spiritual decay. His divine bloodline possesses the power to restore even heavily corrupted planes of existence.",
        personality: ["Boundlessly Compassionate", "Selfless", "Endlessly Forgiving", "Unshakable Inner Stregth"],
        factionImpact: "While the Fallen Titans spread corruption and the Primordial Deities manipulate cosmic power for personal gain, Jesus offers a path few others can — full restoration of those tainted by darkness. His existence weakens the grip of the Titans’ corruption and disrupts the Deities’ cycles of dominion, forcing both opposing factions to confront the possibility of their own redemption or annihilation. His sacrifice remains an ongoing force that reshapes the very battlegrounds themselves."

        name: "Lao Tzu",
        title: "The Eternal Sage of Tao",

        rarity: "Legendary",
        avatar: "LT",
        image: "images/legendary/Laozi.jpg", // Add: images/legendary_char_4.jpg
        loreBackground: `Long before the cosmos fully took shape, before stars illuminated the heavens or time charted its course, there existed the formless Tao — the primordial way of existence. From this infinite current of harmony, balance, and non-resistance, Lao Tzu was born — not as a conqueror or a warrior, but as the embodiment of universal flow itself.

Unlike many Ascendants who wield overwhelming power, Lao Tzu’s strength lies in subtlety. His wisdom flows like water: soft, yet capable of eroding mountains. He became the silent architect behind many of the Divine Ascendants’ most crucial doctrines, ensuring that their pursuit of order never became tyranny, and that light never blinded itself with pride.

While others engaged in open warfare, Lao Tzu operated in the spaces between conflict — guiding leaders, tempering rage, and offering clarity to those teetering on the edge of darkness. His presence is rare on battlefields, but his influence can be felt in every strategy, alliance, and whispered counsel. To walk with Lao Tzu is to witness the stillness beneath all motion, the calm beneath all storms.

Though ancient beyond measure, he carries no arrogance. Instead, he sees himself as a mere vessel through which the Tao expresses its eternal balance.`,
        role: "Lao Tzu serves as the ultimate philosopher and strategist among the Divine Ascendants, often mediating between conflicting leaders and preventing internal fracturing. His teachings have shaped the faction’s entire worldview, keeping them grounded in humility while resisting the seductive pull of absolute control.",
        signaturePower: "Path of Non-Resistance — Through mastery of the Tao, Lao Tzu redirects hostile energies, causing even the most violent attacks to dissipate harmlessly or return to their source. His presence destabilizes aggression while strengthening harmony.",
        personality: ["Tranquil", "Deeply Introspective", "Profoundly Wise", "Eternally Humble"],
        factionImpact: "While the Fallen Titans rage with corruption and the Primordial Deities attempt cosmic dominion, Lao Tzu serves as a stabilizing force, ensuring the Divine Ascendants never stray from their higher purpose. His teachings prepare new Ascendants to resist the temptations of power, making him the spiritual backbone of the faction’s war effort. Though rarely seen on the front lines, many believe that if Lao Tzu were to fall, the moral foundation of the Divine Ascendants would crumble."

        avatar: "M",
        image: "images/legendary/Moses.jpg", // Add: images/legendary_char_5.jpg
        loreBackground: `Before the great schism between realms, when mankind struggled beneath chaos and oppression, the Supreme Source reached into the mortal plane and called forth Moses. Born among an enslaved people yet destined for divine appointment, Moses was chosen to serve as a conduit between the heavens and earth — a mortal elevated into the ranks of the Divine Ascendants.

Through divine command, Moses confronted earthly tyrants and parted the very sea itself, leading his people to freedom under the watchful eye of the Source. Yet his greatest gift was not the miracles he performed, but the Law he carried — a covenant forged between Creator and creation to establish order, justice, and moral foundation across countless worlds.

Among the Divine Ascendants, Moses is revered as the embodiment of righteous authority. His unbreakable stone tablets, inscribed with celestial fire, serve as eternal reminders that power without law leads only to ruin. While others lead through might or wisdom, Moses leads through divine mandate, holding even fellow Ascendants accountable to the Covenant.

Though stern, he carries a deep compassion for the innocent and oppressed. His heart remains forever tethered to both the heavenly realm and the suffering of mortal souls, making him both lawgiver and advocate.`,
        role: "Moses serves as the judicial pillar of the Divine Ascendants. He is tasked with interpreting the Supreme Law in times of crisis, settling disputes among the Ascendants, and ensuring that their war against evil remains morally grounded and never strays into unchecked dominance.",
        signaturePower: "Command of the Covenant — Wields divine authority to invoke heavenly decrees, binding both enemies and allies to sacred contracts. His staff channels the power of creation itself, capable of splitting entire landscapes or sealing gateways between realms.",

His laws serve not only as governance but as a spiritual shield against moral decay, preserving the faction’s purity amidst the ever-deepening war. His presence holds the Divine Ascendants accountable, ensuring their light remains untarnished."

        avatar: "AR",
        image: "images/epic/archangel raphael.jpg", // Add: images/epic_char_1.jpg
        loreBackground: `From the breath of the Supreme Source came forth the celestial legions — divine extensions of light tasked with safeguarding existence. Among them rose Archangel Raphael, born not of conquest, but of restoration. His very essence is woven into the fabric of healing, renewal, and the restoration of what has been corrupted by war and sin.

Throughout the ages, Raphael has descended across countless realms, mending bodies, spirits, and even entire worlds torn asunder by conflict. Where others wield swords and judgment, Raphael carries the Celestial Staff of Restoration, capable of knitting together broken bones, shattered souls, and poisoned lands. His touch dissolves sickness; his presence inspires hope to those on the brink of despair.

Even as the Divine Ascendants wage war against the Fallen Titans and Primordial Deities, Raphael walks amidst the wounded on every battlefield. His mercy knows no allegiance, often healing even the defeated enemy, seeing all life as sacred extensions of the Source’s design. This radical compassion sets him apart even among his fellow Ascendants.

Despite his gentle nature, Raphael possesses immeasurable spiritual fortitude — able to resist the most insidious corruptions and stand unshaken in the face of cosmic devastation.`,

        avatar: "AU",
        image: "images/epic/archangel uriel.jpg", // Add: images/epic_char_2.jpg
        loreBackground: `When the Supreme Source cast forth light to separate order from chaos, knowledge itself was born as a living flame — from this eternal flame emerged Archangel Uriel, the embodiment of divine intellect and sacred illumination. Unlike the warriors who carry swords into battle, Uriel wields truth, clarity, and foresight as his ultimate weapons.

Throughout countless ages, Uriel has served as the guardian of heavenly secrets, the interpreter of hidden codes, and the keeper of prophecies yet to unfold. His mind traverses past, present, and potential futures, discerning patterns even the greatest deities fail to see. He was present at the writing of cosmic laws, etching them into the pillars of creation itself.

Within the Divine Ascendants, Uriel serves as the illuminator — exposing the hidden strategies of both the Fallen Titans and the Primordial Deities, unraveling their schemes before they take form. His lantern, fueled by eternal flame, reveals illusions, deceptions, and concealed threats, leaving no corner of existence untouched by his piercing gaze.

Uriel’s wisdom, however, is tempered by humility. He recognizes that knowledge, if not balanced with mercy, easily transforms into cold judgment. Thus, he often serves as counselor to his fellow Ascendants, ensuring their pursuit of victory never blinds them to the cost of arrogance.`,
        role: "Uriel serves as the Divine Ascendants’ chief seer and strategic analyst, guiding the faction with insights into enemy tactics, divine prophecies, and cosmic patterns. His revelations often shift the tide of war before a single weapon is raised.",

His counsel allows the Divine Ascendants to prepare for invasions, uncover internal traitors, and thwart existential manipulations that would otherwise catch them off guard."

        title: "The Architect of Dominion",
        faction: "Divine Ascendants",

        avatar: "KS",
        image: "images/epic/king solomon.jpg", // Add: images/epic_char_3.jpg
        loreBackground: `Before his ascension, Solomon reigned as one of history’s most legendary monarchs — a man gifted by the Supreme Source with unparalleled wisdom and authority. His rule was marked not only by political mastery but by supernatural command over spirits, dimensions, and sacred knowledge few mortals could comprehend.

Through divine favor, Solomon constructed the Temple — a gateway between realms — and inscribed the legendary Seals of Dominion, granting him command over legions of celestial and subjugated beings alike. His throne became both a seat of earthly governance and a beacon of higher order, merging the mortal and divine under a single unified law.

After fulfilling his mortal destiny, Solomon was elevated into the ranks of the Divine Ascendants, where his mastery over spiritual forces and inter-dimensional hierarchies became critical in the ongoing war between factions. Unlike others who fight with brute strength, Solomon binds and commands powers to serve the cause of balance, turning enemies into instruments of peace or neutralizing destructive forces before they can fully awaken.

Yet behind his unmatched intellect lies a constant internal battle — for with great power comes temptation. Solomon walks the razor’s edge between righteous authority and the risk of falling into domination, forever guarded by his covenant with the Source.`,
        role: "Solomon serves as the Divine Ascendants’ master of spiritual governance and containment. He crafts the seals, barriers, and mystical contracts that hold back destructive forces, imprison rogue entities, and maintain the spiritual boundaries of the known realms.",

Without his oversight, the balance of power would collapse under the weight of uncontrolled forces."

        image: "images/epic/principality overseer.jpg", // Add: images/epic_char_4.jpg
        loreBackground: `When the Supreme Source divided the realms, the mortal nations were entrusted to celestial beings known as Principalities — divine stewards tasked with guiding entire civilizations according to the laws of harmony and justice. Among them, the Principality Overseer was elevated above all, serving as the supreme guardian of nations and cosmic order.

From the rise and fall of empires to the forging of alliances across dimensions, the Overseer ensures that no realm descends entirely into tyranny or chaos. Though rarely intervening directly, his influence is constantly present — gently nudging kings toward righteousness, averting catastrophes, and extinguishing seeds of rebellion planted by the Fallen Titans and Primordial Deities.

His knowledge spans political structures, economic balances, and cultural evolution across entire civilizations. No war, treaty, or rebellion occurs without the Overseer feeling its ripple. While many Divine Ascendants battle on the front lines, the Overseer wages a more delicate war: the preservation of stability itself.

In rare instances, when nations collapse under demonic or godly corruption, the Overseer descends directly — wielding his Heavenly Scepter, capable of neutralizing armies without shedding blood, restoring balance with an authority that leaves even opposing forces paralyzed.`,
        role: "The Principality Overseer maintains the stability of mortal realms, preventing enemy factions from corrupting entire nations into tools of darkness. His intervention ensures that balance exists not just in the heavens, but across the physical dimensions where mortal souls reside.",

        loreBackground: `Before the celestial realms fully formed, Enoch walked as a mortal man whose life was so righteous, so attuned to divine will, that he was taken by the Supreme Source without tasting death. Unlike other prophets, his ascension did not simply elevate him into the heavens — it transformed him into something entirely new: Metatron, the Arch-Scribe of all existence.

Now among the highest of the Divine Ascendants, Metatron records the unfolding events of creation, documenting every soul’s journey, every decision, and every ripple across the multiverse. His knowledge surpasses even the greatest scholars of the heavens, for his scrolls are inscribed not by hand, but by the threads of time itself.

Though often removed from direct battle, Metatron’s role is critical — for the written law, recorded in the Celestial Codex, shapes the very boundaries of reality. His words solidify destiny, preventing enemy factions from rewriting creation’s foundations.

When summoned into war, Metatron becomes a force of absolute precision — calling forth the written decree of the Source itself, nullifying attacks, erasing false realities, and sealing away forbidden knowledge weaponized by his enemies.`,
        role: "Metatron serves as the supreme archivist and guardian of the cosmic narrative. His recordings maintain the lawful structure of existence, preventing both Titans and Deities from altering reality’s underlying framework.",

        loreBackground: `Formed from the harmonious breath of the Supreme Source, Sandalphon governs the sacred art of celestial resonance — the binding frequency that holds existence together. Where many wage war through force, Sandalphon’s battlefield is the vibration of creation itself.

Through divine music, he channels the harmonies that stabilize realms, purify corrupted energies, and even calm the rage of opposing forces. His melodies are more than sound — they are threads woven directly into the Source’s rhythm, capable of healing fractured realms or dissolving spells of unimaginable power.

When summoned into battle, Sandalphon’s symphony can uplift entire armies, restoring their resolve while disorienting corrupted enemies. His compositions break demonic chants, counteract destructive rituals, and return balance to regions destabilized by war.

His presence radiates an aura of such purity that unworthy beings are unable to stand before him.

The Throne Angel neither hates nor loves his enemies — he simply enforces the balance written into existence. Once a verdict is passed, no force — not even the Titans or the Deities — may overturn it. His mere arrival on any battlefield signals that divine patience has ended and justice is being executed.

Among these, one Virtue Spirit stands as the highest conduit of pure intervention, called forth when reality itself must be momentarily suspended to preserve balance. Her appearance on the battlefield signals that the Source has allowed a temporary suspension of natural law, bending probability itself to deliver salvation or decisive strikes.

Unlike warriors or strategists, the Virtue Spirit moves quietly behind the scenes, orchestrating perfect alignments that avert catastrophes — redirecting enemy strikes, resurrecting key figures at pivotal moments, or delivering impossible victories against overwhelming odds.

Unlike many Ascendants who respond to war with force, Zadkiel moves through battlefields as both protector and intercessor, calming the hearts of the lost, softening the rage of enemy champions, and at times even converting foes into allies through acts of unconditional forgiveness.

His mercy is not weakness but power — for mercy dismantles hatred at its root. Even the Fallen Titans whisper his name with unease, knowing that his compassion threatens to undo centuries of corruption with a single embrace.

When mercy is rejected, however, Zadkiel’s wrath awakens — and his blade becomes an instrument of swift, decisive judgment.`,

His redemptive power weakens the enemy’s ranks not through destruction, but through restoration — a threat few opposing leaders can counter."

        loreBackground: `Among mortals, Elijah was chosen as one of the few to walk so closely with the Supreme Source that death itself could not claim him. After fulfilling his prophetic mission—confronting kings, defying idols, and demonstrating divine power—Elijah was taken into the heavens alive, ascending in a chariot of fire that pierced the dimensional veil.

Upon his ascension, Elijah was transformed — no longer simply prophet, but an eternal flame within the Divine Ascendants. His Chariot of Flame became more than a symbol of his elevation; it became his celestial vessel, capable of traveling across dimensions, striking enemies, and shielding entire cities with fiery protection.

While other Ascendants maintain the boundaries between realms, Elijah moves freely between them, delivering divine intervention wherever the war grows most unstable. He operates as both messenger and battlefield disruptor — appearing suddenly where hope is lost, igniting the battlefield with celestial flame that incinerates corruption while sparing the innocent.

His bond with both mortal suffering and divine authority grants him a rare duality: fearless before kings, humble before the Source.`,

        loreBackground: `At the moment of cosmic awakening, when the first fragments of light pierced the void, Aelion was born from the primordial surge — not as a supreme leader or commander, but as the first radiant beacon guiding countless celestial beings into formation. His purpose was simple yet immeasurably profound: to be the flame that ignites the resolve of others.

As legions of Divine Ascendants assembled in the early ages, Aelion’s light became their first rallying point — the standard by which they gathered and the warmth that bound their hearts. His aura cuts through despair, restoring clarity to faltering warriors and reigniting purpose amidst the most chaotic conflicts.

Though not among the faction’s supreme hierarchy, Aelion’s role is irreplaceable. He is the one who goes before the legions, the first presence to arrive on corrupted battlefields, dispelling spiritual darkness so others may follow without hesitation. His radiance serves not as a weapon of destruction, but as a torch lighting the path toward restoration and unity.

His faith in the Supreme Source is unwavering, and while others engage in judgment, healing, or battle, Aelion’s sole charge is to carry the dawn into every war zone — reminding the cosmos that even in endless conflict, light always returns.`,

        loreBackground: `Formed from the flowing rivers of divine compassion, Seraphel was birthed as one of the earliest celestial healers — a being whose very wings emit waves of soothing grace across the battlefield. Where others are called to judgment or conquest, Seraphel’s mandate is mercy — to mend, restore, and preserve the fragile balance between destruction and healing.

In the great wars against the Fallen Titans and Primordial Deities, Seraphel drifts above battlefields like a living prayer, spreading currents of life across wounded warriors and civilians alike. Her light doesn’t discriminate between allies and enemies — for wherever life clings to hope, her touch restores vitality.

Yet beneath her gentle exterior lies tremendous fortitude. Seraphel willingly descends into the most corrupted realms where few dare follow, extending healing to souls on the brink of annihilation. Her presence alone is enough to stall waves of despair, preventing the mental collapse of entire legions battered by overwhelming odds.

Her role complements Archangel Raphael, but unlike Raphael’s masterful restoration, Seraphel focuses on mass battlefield stabilization, rapidly healing broad numbers while sustaining the Ascendants’ fighting strength in prolonged conflicts.`,

        loreBackground: `Forged in the earliest celestial forges by the Supreme Source itself, Valeris was created not to strike, but to shield.

His Aegis of the Heavens was forged from crystallized divine light, capable of absorbing both physical and spiritual attacks. Entire legions have fought confidently under Valeris’ protection, knowing that even the most devastating strikes from the Titans or Deities would shatter against his impenetrable shield.

Valeris has stood at the frontlines of countless sieges, personally protecting key gates, sanctuaries, and Ascendant leaders. His mere presence stabilizes collapsing defenses, buying time for healers, commanders, and warriors to regroup. Where walls crumble and barriers fail, Valeris remains — the final wall between annihilation and survival.

Though not as commanding as the faction’s high leaders, Valeris is widely respected by Ascendants and mortals alike, often referred to as the Last Wall.`,

Born from the union of wisdom and righteous fury, he serves as the Divine Ascendants’ enforcer of battlefield order — punishing the wicked while safeguarding those who remain faithful to the Source.

Elyndor’s sword, known as the Blade of Judgement, does not simply wound or destroy — it weighs the spiritual essence of its target. The guilty are struck down in final retribution, while the repentant are spared, cleansed by radiant light instead of annihilation.

Unlike the Throne Angel who delivers irreversible divine verdicts, Elyndor operates within the active flow of war — executing precise strikes that stabilize chaos before it spirals into full corruption. His judgments are immediate, delivered with surgical precision as conflicts unfold.

Though fierce in battle, Elyndor carries a profound sense of fairness. He studies each conflict not only by who fights, but by why they fight. This perspective allows him to distinguish corrupted victims from willful agents of darkness, ensuring no soul is condemned unjustly.`,

When great cosmic shifts threaten the stability of realms, Thaloren’s visions become critical to the faction’s preparation. His insights guide armies, dictate alliances, and help leaders avoid traps set by both the Fallen Titans and Primordial Deities.

Yet his burden is great — for the stars rarely show outcomes with certainty. He constantly navigates countless futures, weighing which sacrifices may be necessary to secure ultimate balance.`,

Cassiel’s gift is not prophecy nor judgment — it is pure observation. No whisper, no secret meeting, no forbidden ritual escapes the gaze of the Silent Watcher. While others speak loudly on battlefields, Cassiel remains unseen, feeding intelligence to the Divine Ascendants long before threats fully emerge.

Even among the Divine Ascendants, few ever meet Cassiel directly. His presence is rarely felt, but his work is foundational to every tactical success. Through the Veil of Silence, Cassiel moves unseen across battlefronts, demonic strongholds, and forbidden dimensions, gathering crucial knowledge without alerting the enemy.

Though detached emotionally, Cassiel’s loyalty to the Source is absolute. His silence is not apathy — it is discipline. He knows that to observe without interference is often the greatest service to balance.`,

Oriphiel stands before the Celestial Gates, wielding his divine spear as a living blockade against dimensional corruption.

Jophiel is not a combatant in the traditional sense; rather, his weapon is sacred construction. Through his mastery of divine geometry, he forges sanctuaries, war structures, spiritual defenses, and relics that fuel the Divine Ascendants’ long-term endurance across countless battlefronts.

His Architect of Wonders ability allows him to rapidly manifest protective structures, complex fortresses, and energy conduits that amplify the strength of his allies.

Oriphiel stands before the Celestial Gates, wielding his divine spear as a living blockade against dimensional corruption. The Titans and Deities both seek to exploit unstable gateways to summon reinforcements, open breaches, or shift wars into forbidden realms — and it is Oriphiel who stands as the first—and often final—defense against such incursions.

While the great sages and prophets peer into grand cosmic designs, Althiel operates on a more intimate scale — guiding wandering souls, lost warriors, and newly ascended beings toward understanding their place within the Source’s grand tapestry.

His light is gentle, never forceful, illuminating truths rather than imposing them. In times of war, Althiel often moves among the newly summoned ranks, teaching discipline, harmony, and wisdom to those unaccustomed to the weight of divine responsibility.

Althiel’s Beacon of Knowledge does not grant him prophetic power, but allows him to read the hearts of those around him, identifying confusion, doubt, and fear — and gently dispersing these shadows with compassionate counsel.

When celestial war councils must coordinate across dimensions, it is often Aurel who ensures critical messages arrive before disaster can unfold.

Though not a combatant by design, Aurel’s missions often take him through dangerous war zones, relying on extreme precision, reflexes, and divine protection to navigate these perilous runs.

Unlike archivists who safeguard existing knowledge, Caelum ventures into unknown territories, mapping unstable dimensions, charting star-fields, and uncovering lost fragments of the Supreme Source’s designs. His journeys often place him near the edges of corrupted zones or into void spaces where reality itself thins.

Through his Eternal Seeker gift, Caelum remains unharmed while navigating chaotic realms, allowing him to recover artifacts, discover enemy outposts, or locate ancient structures critical to the Divine Ascendants’ long-term survival.

Often stationed on the front lines where spiritual corruption festers, Damaris wades into battle under waves of demonic assault, encasing vulnerable soldiers within his flame’s protective embrace. The Fallen Titans fear his purging fire, which not only incinerates dark forces but severs their corrupting tendrils from potential hosts.

Her role mirrors Ophiel’s vast archive but on a more tactical scale. Elzara maintains detailed scrolls of frontline developments, tracking enemy movements, battlefield anomalies, and emerging patterns of corruption that allow Ascendant commanders to adjust their strategies in real-time.

Her Sacred Scribe ability allows her to inscribe living scrolls that remain spiritually linked to active battlefields, updating dynamically as events unfold. This unique field-reporting grants Ascendant leadership invaluable foresight.`,

Wielding the Radiant Spear, Vashiel functions as a battlefield executioner — capable of bypassing thick demonic armor, corrupted auras, and defensive enchantments with surgical strikes that deliver instant purification to even high-ranking enemy commanders.

Vashiel is often deployed in strike teams, neutralizing key targets that, if left unchecked, would destabilize critical Ascendant positions.

Unlike Theliel’s wide-scale judgment, Vashiel’s strikes are highly targeted — erasing specific threats that would otherwise inspire waves of demonic momentum.`,

        loreBackground: `When despair threatens to overtake both mortals and Ascendants alike, Velthiel appears as a luminous presence — a living beacon who reignites faith even in the darkest hour.

His Spirit of Hope power doesn’t merely inspire — it mends broken willpower, restores shattered confidence, and reignites the conviction of those ready to surrender. Entire regions ravaged by demonic sieges have been stabilized by Velthiel’s arrival alone.

Though not an offensive combatant, Velthiel’s role is essential to maintaining spiritual cohesion during prolonged sieges and catastrophic events where despair would otherwise spread unchecked.`,

Where other warriors strike with absolutes, Yirath operates in the shadows, discerning whether a soul can still be turned from corruption before irreversible judgment is cast.

His Shadow of Mercy allows him to weaken demonic possession, suppress destructive impulses, and offer final opportunities for surrender. Yet, when mercy is rejected, Yirath executes swift retribution without hesitation.

Yirath is often assigned to contested regions where corrupted souls may still be redeemable — offering salvation first, but annihilation if refused.`,

His Winds of Fate allow him to subtly manipulate probability, tilting minor variables in favor of the Divine Ascendants while avoiding overt disruptions that would violate cosmic law. Through his delicate interventions, missed strikes land, fortuitous defenses arise, and small errors accumulate into decisive advantages.

Zephariel’s work is especially critical during close conflicts, where his unseen hand turns otherwise uncertain battles toward victory.`,
